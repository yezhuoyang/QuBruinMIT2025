This is the solution of QuBruin for MIT 2024 Hackathon.
We take the challenge problem provided by QuEra.
The goal is to compile and optimize different quantum circuits to neutral atom hardware. 


# Process

First, we implement a gateset with CNOT,CZ,Rx,Ry,Rz on the Neutral atom system.  

We use qiskit transpiler to compile the challenge circuit to our gate set.

After transpilation, we implement and challenge circuit and apply different rules by hand to optimize the circuit.
